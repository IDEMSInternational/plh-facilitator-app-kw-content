They are still learning how to behave in different situations.\n\nAs a parent, you can help them understand that their actions affect themselves and others. \n\nGiving clear consequences teaches children to take responsibility for their actions, more than hitting or shouting does.\n\nSome consequences happen naturally (if they break a toy, they cannot play with it), other consequences you set to help your child follow instructions or rules (if you do not pack away your toys, you wonâ€™t be allowed to play with them tomorrow).",

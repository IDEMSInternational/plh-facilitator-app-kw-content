Learning how to solve problems together with your child can help you prevent conflict. \n\nAs children get older, they will be able to work through their problems by themselves more often. \n\nThis will set them up for success throughout their life. What a gift!",

I am hungry!\n\nBy involving our children in solving problems, they learn to find solutions more and more independently. \n\nLife has its challenges. If you help your child solve small problems today, you give them the skills to deal with any bigger challenges later in life.",
